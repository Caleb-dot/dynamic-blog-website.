# dynamic-blog-website.
This project is a dynamic, multi-page blog website that allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) blog posts. The posts are stored in the browser's local storage, meaning they persist even after refreshing the page but do not require a backend or database.

The project follows Git and GitHub workflows, requiring proper branching, commits, and pull requests. The final website will have:

A Homepage (index.html) – Displays a list of blog posts.

A New Post Page (new-post.html) – Allows users to create and save new blog posts.

A Post Detail Page (post.html) – Displays a full blog post, with options to edit or delete it.
